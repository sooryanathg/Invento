            <span className="font-extrabold">INVENTO</span> began with a spark—students who believed learning didn’t have to stop at classroom walls. What started as a small technical gathering soon revealed a bigger possibility: a space where curiosity could turn into creation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm md:text-lg font-medium leading-relaxed w-full">
            As that idea grew, it took its first form as GHATECH—a multi-day technical exhibition that brought together students from multiple institutions. The involvement of nationally recognized organizations such as DRDO, along with early industry collaborators, marked a turning point. This was no longer just a campus initiative; it was gaining momentum beyond it.

            <p className="text-sm md:text-lg font-medium leading-relaxed md:w-[90%]">
              Then came the transformation. Technology met creativity. Innovation shared the stage with art, performance, and culture. The festival evolved into Invento—a platform where ideas, expression, and identity could coexist. A space that proved students didn’t have to choose between logic and imagination—they could lead with both.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm md:text-lg font-medium leading-relaxed md:w-full">
              With every edition, Invento grew bolder. Collaborations with institutions such as ISRO and professional bodies like the IEEE, along with participation from colleges across the country, shaped Invento into a national-level techno-cultural festival.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm md:text-lg font-medium leading-relaxed w-full">
              Today, Invento stands as an open platform—shaped by students, strengthened by collaboration, and driven by ideas that continue to redefine what’s possible. A journey still unfolding, with every edition adding a new chapter.
